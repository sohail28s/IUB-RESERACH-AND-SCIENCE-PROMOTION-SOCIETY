On July 22, 2024, we conducted an engaging webinar on the use of AI tools in research, which was also live-streamed on Facebook. The session explored how various AI tools can enhance different aspects of research work. These tools offer powerful capabilities for analyzing complex data, automating repetitive tasks, and improving information retrieval. By leveraging natural language processing, machine learning, and advanced analytics, researchers can streamline their workflows, gain deeper insights, and increase the efficiency of their research methodologies. The webinar aimed to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of how to integrate AI into their research processes to achieve more effective and impactful outcomes.
