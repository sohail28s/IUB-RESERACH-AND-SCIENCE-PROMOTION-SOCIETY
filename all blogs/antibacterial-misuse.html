                    Antibacterial misuse refers to the improper and extensive use of antibacterial agents which can lead
                    further to the bacterial resistance. Antibiotics are the medicines that eliminate bacterial
                    infections
                    by either killing the bacteria or inhibiting its reproduction. They work by different mechanisms
                    such as
                    interfering with synthesis of bacterial cell wall-a structure not possessed by mammalian cells (e.g.
                    penicillin), by targeting bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis (e.g.
                    tetracycline) or by interrupting the replication of genetic material (e.g. fluoroquinolones).
                    Selection
                    of antibiotics is a very crucial step which requires proper knowledge of the identity of the
                    organism,
                    site of infection, patient factor, safety or cost of drug.

                    Bacteria are considered resistant to antibiotic if the maximal dose of antibiotic that can be
                    tolerated
                    by the host does not cease bacterial growth. Bacteria develops more resistant strains with enhanced
                    protective mechanisms or modified target sites in response to antibiotics.Antibiotic resistance is
                    accelerated by the indiscriminate and overuse of antibiotics. Number of infections such as
                    tuberculosis,
                    pneumonia, gonorrhea etc are becoming difficult to treat as the antibiotics used to treat became
                    less
                    effective. Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to global health declared by World
                    Health
                    Organization. It occurs naturally overtime through genetic variations and spread easily from person
                    to
                    person, food from animals or contaminated water. Antibiotic resistance is most prevalent in India,
                    China, Russia, Brazil and some countries of United States. It is responsible for approximately
                    700,000
                    deaths per year worldwide.

                    Many physicians (mostly in developing countries) recommend antibiotics without identifying the true
                    nature of pathogen causing infection due to limited resources. In several cases, antibiotics are
                    administered in viral infections e.g. flu, common cold, whooping cough etc. Taking them wonâ€™t treat
                    infection and promote antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Moreover there is a huge pressure on health
                    workers from patients to provide antibiotics without any prescription or diagnostic tests. Repeated
                    administration of antibiotic kills both harmful and beneficial microorganisms in our body totally
                    disrupting the natural flora of our gut and other parts of body leading to many metabolic disorders,
                    digestive problems and decrease immunity in our body. The bacteria becomes more resistant and
                    develops
                    advanced protective mechanisms to fight with antibiotics. For example Mycobacterium tuberculosis is
                    a
                    pathogen that causes tuberculosis is now resisant to multiple antibiotics such as Rifampin or
                    Isoniazid.
                    Staphylococcus, which is responsible for several skin infections, food poisoning, pneumonia etc is
                    now
                    resistant to many antibiotics including methicillin and other penicillin like drugs.

                    Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern in healthcare which requires multisectoral cooperation to
                    launch different programs, research centers and medical campaigns to reduce it. Measures should be
                    taken
                    to implement preventive measures (hygiene, vaccines or environmental factors) and guidelines to
                    attain
                    better public health outcomes. People should be encouraged to treat common infections naturally
                    without
                    taking any antibacterial drugs. Patients should complete their entire course of antibiotic
                    administration prescribed by physician. Educate health care professionals and public about the
                    importance of appropriate antibiotics use and side effects of utilization of drugs without any
                    medical
                    prescription. Research centers should be facilitated with modern technologies to ensure the creation
                    of
                    new antibiotics and availability of effective treatments for bacterial infections.

                    World Antibiotic Awareness Weak (WAWW) is a global campaign celebrated from 18 to 24 November to
                    raise
                    awareness against the irrational use of antibiotics and spread of drug resistant pathogens. Moreover
                    WHO
                    has also launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance And Use Surveillance System (GLASS) in 2015 to
                    collect authentic data of the use of antibiotic agents or supervision of antimicrobial resistance in
                    humans from different countries and territories. Moreover many global antibiotic research centers
                    have
                    been launched to devise new treatments for drug resistant infections.
