                <p>Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants and other photosynthetic organisms that plays a crucial role
                    in converting sunlight into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. While chlorophyll
                    itself is not typically used for directly generating electricity, researchers have been exploring
                    ways to harness the principles of photosynthesis and apply them to bio-inspired solar energy
                    systems.</p>

                <p>One such approach is the development of biohybrid solar cells or artificial photosynthesis systems.
                    These systems aim to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis by incorporating chlorophyll or
                    other light-absorbing molecules into devices that can generate electrical energy.</p>

                <p>In biohybrid solar cells, chlorophyll or related molecules are combined with synthetic materials,
                    such as conductive polymers or nanoparticles, to create photoactive layers. These layers can absorb
                    light energy and initiate electron transfer, similar to the process in natural photosynthesis. The
                    excited electrons can then be harnessed to generate an electric current.</p>

                <p>However, it is important to note that the efficiency of biohybrid solar cells is still relatively low
                    compared to traditional silicon-based solar cells. Challenges such as stability, scalability, and
                    overall performance need to be addressed to make biohybrid solar cells a viable alternative for
                    electricity generation.</p>

                <p>Moreover, chlorophyll-based systems are not the only approach being explored in the field of
                    biotechnology for electricity generation. Researchers are also investigating other bio-inspired
                    materials and processes, including using proteins, enzymes, and genetically engineered
                    microorganisms, to convert light energy into electricity or produce biofuels that will generate
                    electricity in other ways.</p>

                <p>All this we have done on a laboratory level and we aim to produce electricity in the next coming
                    days! All of you would be surprised that these amazing projects are going to be held by the
                    Department of Biotechnology, Islamia University of Bahawalpur under students' supervision. Namely:

                <p>2. Ammar Azhar</p>

                <p>4. Laraib Rasool</p>
                <p>5. Ayesha Luqman</p>

                <p>If all of the departments allow the students to work better in their fields, certainly they would
                    revolutionize the fields and earn fame for the university. But unfortunately, there is no such
                    system available!</p>

                <p>In summary, while chlorophyll itself is not directly used for electricity generation, researchers are
                    working on developing biohybrid solar cells and other bio-inspired systems that incorporate
                    chlorophyll or related molecules to harness sunlight and generate electrical energy. These
                    technologies are still in the early stages of development, but they hold promise for future
                    advancements in biotechnology and renewable energy.</p>
