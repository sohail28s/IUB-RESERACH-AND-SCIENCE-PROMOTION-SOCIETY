                <p>You will be shocked if you get to know the leading cause of dandruff which appears in the form of
                    white flakes in hair. We all are always concerned about the thing that how dandruff forms and why is
                    it so itchy.</p>

                <p>So the thing is in a healthy scalp, dead skin cells shed constantly, and new ones grow to take their
                    place. But people who suffer from dandruff, experience this shedding at a faster rate with some
                    seriously unpleasant consequences, and it is all related to Malassezia globosa, which is a fungus.
                </p>

                <p>The Malassezia on the scalp feeds on the sebum that’s produced by your scalp to keep your hair
                    hydrated.</p>

                <p>Oleic acid is a byproduct that is released as the sebum degrades. Even though oleic acid is safe,
                    over 50% of people show being allergic to this byproduct.</p>

                <p>This irritant makes the scalp becomes red and irritated so the body speeds up the rate at which skin
                    cells regenerate in order to remove this irritant from the scalp This is the root of flaking.</p>

                <p>On the scalp, these dead cells build up until they are visible in your hair and begin to fall on your
                    shoulders.</p>

                <p>Along with the appearance of flaking and dandruff, you might experience an itchy, dry, inflamed, and
                    red scalp. These symptoms are your body’s response to the irritation caused by the microbe. So in
                    such a condition you should use anti-dandruff and fungistatic products to prevent dandruff.</p>
