                <p>The young generation is experiencing a rising trend of depression and dissatisfaction within the
                    degree programs they choose. This phenomenon has garnered significant attention as it affects their
                    overall well-being and academic performance. Understanding the underlying factors contributing to
                    this issue is crucial in addressing the challenges faced by today's youth.</p>

                <p><b>1. High expectations and pressures:</b> The modern era places immense pressure on young individuals to
                    excel academically. Unrealistic expectations from parents, society, and even themselves create an
                    environment where the pursuit of a degree becomes a source of stress rather than fulfillment. The
                    constant pressure to achieve top grades and secure a successful career can lead to feelings of
                    anxiety and inadequacy.</p>

                <p><b>2. Mismatched Career Goals:</b> Many students enter degree programs without a clear understanding of
                    their personal interests, passions, and career goals. This lack of self-awareness can result in
                    choosing majors that are not aligned with their true aspirations. Consequently, students may feel
                    disconnected, uninterested, and uninspired, leading to a sense of dissatisfaction with their chosen
                    programs.</p>

                <p><b>3. Limited Practical Relevance:</b> Some degree programs are perceived as lacking practical application
                    in real-world settings. When students are unable to see the direct connection between what they are
                    learning and its practical implementation, they may question the value and purpose of their
                    education. This perceived gap between theory and practice can contribute to a feeling of
                    disillusionment among students.</p>

                <p><b>4. Academic Burnout:</b> The intense workload and competitive nature of degree programs can lead to
                    burnout among students. The constant pressure to perform well academically, coupled with a lack of
                    adequate support systems, can exhaust students mentally and physically. Burnout negatively impacts
                    their motivation, engagement, and overall happiness within their chosen programs.</p>

                <p><b>5. Insufficient Mental Health Support:</b> Despite the growing awareness of mental health issues, many
                    educational institutions still lack adequate resources and support for students facing depression
                    and anxiety. The stigma surrounding mental health further exacerbates the problem, discouraging
                    students from seeking help. The absence of comprehensive mental health services within educational
                    settings leaves students feeling isolated and unsupported.</p>

                <p><h3>Conclusion:</h3> The increasing prevalence of depression and dissatisfaction among the young generation
                    in their degree programs is a multifaceted issue. It stems from various factors such as high
                    expectations, mismatched career goals, limited practical relevance, academic burnout, and inadequate
                    mental health support. Addressing this issue requires a collective effort from educational
                    institutions, parents, and society at large to create an environment that fosters holistic
                    well-being, personal growth, and meaningful learning experiences for today's youth.</p>

                <p>Dear parents and Guardians Please avoid pressuring your children in selecting their bachelor's degree
                    programs. When the subject isn't chosen based on their own interest, it creates unnecessary stress,
                    hindering their performance and potential. Let them independently choose their path, utilizing their
                    God-given abilities. Encourage their autonomy.</p>
